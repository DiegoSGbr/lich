// A bug report is a browser hand-off, never a `gh` call. Two reasons, and both
// outlive the convenience: `gh issue create` cannot attach a file, and the log
// file is the attachment; and a project can name a gh account other than the
// logged-in one (the vcs.account ceiling), so "which account files this?" has
// no answer a single button can pick. lich prefills the form; the user sends it.
